# The GCC Economic Integration Index project is a roof-of-concept stage of developing a quantitative framework designed to measure the depth and progress of economic 
# integration among the six Gulf Cooperation Council member states. Developed by GCC-Stat's Economic Statistics Department, this index will provide policymakers and 
# researchers with a systematic tool to monitor regional integration across multiple economic dimensions, identify integration gaps, and guide strategic interventions.
